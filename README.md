# Lightfall Countdown

This is just a small app I threw together that displays the amount of time left until Destin 2: Lightfall releases in your system tray.

If you want to have the app launch at startup, you can add the executable to the startup apps folder located here:

>C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

If you want to remove the app, you can either go back to that directory and remove it or you can go to Settings > Apps > Startup and uncheck the box next to the app like so:

Click the __Releases__ tab on the left to download the app.

Windows will probably scan the file for viruses and warn you when first trying to run the file. This is because I couldn't be fucked to learn how to create and sign a certificate that had my name on it in Visual Studio. If you have any doubts, consult the code.
